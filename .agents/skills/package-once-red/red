// A static import would fail during resolution, before any line of this file
// runs, with a bare "Cannot find package" naming no fix. The import stays
// dynamic so the failure can be answered instead of reported. The answer cannot
// live in the package for the obvious reason: the package is what is missing.
//
// Ordinary resolution still wins when it succeeds, which is what keeps a
// checkout usable — the same role green's classpath check plays before it calls
